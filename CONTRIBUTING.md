# Contributing


## Prior To Contribution __(Important)__


You *must* have access to GitHub and a GitHub account.


## Forking typr 


First, you will have to obtain your copy of the typr repository, also known as "forking". Click [here](https://github.com/DriftingOtter/Typr/fork) to open the fork wizard or go to the top right of your screen and then click the `fork` button.


## Making Changes


You can either make changes directly to the newly forked repo in your account via the GitHub web client, or you can use whatever personal text editor/IDE to make changes to the repo. I prefer [neovim](https://neovim.io/), but that is totally up to you!


Once you have made all the changes to the files you want, commit them to the current branch you are on - most likely ```main```.


Please be thoughtful, and give a concise, yet informative description of what you have changed via the ```-m``` flag during your commit - if you use it locally - or via the GUI description section of the commit - if using web or VS Code.


## Creating a Pull Request

It's always good practice to ```git pull``` to check if your repo is on the latest version of ```main``` as many changes can occur on any certain day, and it will help you not have as many merge conflicts later on.


After you are done making all the changes to the repo, come back to ___this___ repo and you will see near the top of the repo files sections, a drop-down button to contribute. Clicking this button will create a new PR (Pull Request).


Remember to add a good and detailed description to your PR and __double-check__ if the destination branches at the top look correct. The ```base repository``` and the ```base branch``` should be listed as ```DriftingOtter/Typr``` and ```main```respectively, and on the right of that should be your forked repo and the branch you have made changes in.


Once done, click on ```Create pull request``` to finally publish your PR.


## Merging Your Pull Request

All you have to do is wait for approval or comments. Once your PR is approved, you can merge your changes!
